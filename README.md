# C++ Pattern Library

This repository contains a collection of C++ functions to generate various pattern prints. Patterns include butterfly patterns, pyramid patterns, numerical patterns, and more.

## Patterns Included

The following patterns are available:

1. Butterfly Patterns
2. Pyramid Patterns
3. Palindromic Pyramid Patterns
4. Numeric Pyramid Patterns
5. Arrow Patterns
6. Star Patterns
7. Diamond Patterns
8. Numeric Hollow Patterns
9. Floyd's Triangle Patterns
10. Pascal's Triangle Patterns
11. Alphabet Patterns
                 and so on.

<div style = "display = "grid"">
<img src = "Screenshots/S (2).png" width = "500" height = "400" alt = "Screenshots">
<img src = "Screenshots/S (3).png" width = "500" height = "400" alt = "Screenshots">
<img src = "Screenshots/S (5).png" width = "500" height = "300" alt = "Screenshots">
<img src = "Screenshots/S (6).png" width = "500" height = "300" alt = "Screenshots">
<img src = "Screenshots/S (4).png" width = "500" height = "600" alt = "Screenshots">
<img src = "Screenshots/S (7).png" width = "500" height = "400" align = "top" alt = "Screenshots">
 

</div>

## How to Use

To use these patterns in your C++ programs, simply include the necessary header files and call the respective functions with the desired parameters. The patterns are implemented as void functions that print the patterns directly to the console.

## Examples

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the library to print a zero-one pattern and Floyd's Triangle:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include"pattern.h"

int main() {
    zero1(5);
    floydTriangle(5);
    return 0;
}
```

This will print the zero-one pattern followed by Floyd's Triangle pattern.
